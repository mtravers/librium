BAD BUGS:
- opener inconsistent behavior

- Tried to sign up for developer API access here http://developer.bibliocommons.com/
  but it never delivered the confirming email...

- group results either by library or ISBN
- clean up CSS
- configuration, with backing site and library like Bookburrito
- annoying that paperback and hardcover editions are completely different ISBNs, but not sure what I can do about that
- Candidate source: https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0671657135
- Candidate source: http://bookzz.org/s/?q=0387310738 (no way to do isbn-specific search or validate result, also probably illegal)
      Works now!  ISBN search eg http://bookos-z1.org/s/?q=9780674175532&yearFrom=&yearTo=&language=&extension=&t=0

- Candidate source: https://openlibrary.org/search?isbn=0478108354
- Here's a page with too many hits: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanita_muscaria
