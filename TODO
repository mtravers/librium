BAD BUGS:

- Will manifest on printed output (Eg from journal). Is there a way to turn it off?

- Bookos still not working quite right. Actual contents sparse and often under a different ISBN

- deal with multiple ISBNs on page? Sometimes 10 and 13 are actually different and both should be searched.
(Perhaps combine this with "group results" and general overhaul to deal with large return sets)

- opener inconsistent behavior

RANDOM IDEAS:

- Tried to sign up for developer API access here http://developer.bibliocommons.com/
  but it never delivered the confirming email...

- group results either by library or ISBN
- clean up CSS
- configuration, with backing site and library like Bookburrito
- annoying that paperback and hardcover editions are completely different ISBNs, but not sure what I can do about that

- Candidate source: https://openlibrary.org/search?isbn=0478108354

- Deal better with large result sets:
   eg, Here's a page with too many hits: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanita_muscaria
