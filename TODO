- group results either by library or ISBN
- somehow extract title for display? ISBN is human-unfriendly. Hm, could be done from query page...
- clean up CSS
- configuration, with backing site and library like Bookburrito
- annoying that paperback and hardcover editions are completely different ISBNs, but not sure what I can do about that
