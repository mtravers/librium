- Need scroll bar, some pages have too many hits eg
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine%E2%80%93American_War
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanita_muscaria
- group results either by library or ISBN
  - and maybe give user some control, eg Worldcat results aren't that useful
- clean up CSS
- configuration, with backing site and library like Bookburrito
- annoying that paperback and hardcover editions are completely different ISBNs, but not sure what I can do about that
