* What

A Chrome extension that will automatically pop up a window if your library(1) has the book you are looking at(2).

- (1) For now, assuming your library is the San Francisco public, San Mateo public, or UCSF libraries. To be further generalized when I get around to it.
- (2) Assuming the ISBN number appears on the page.

* How 

- Chrome > Preferences > Extensions
- Turn on Developer Mode
- Load unpacked extension (point to the this directory)
- Go to an Amazon book page or similar, you should see a popup in the lower-right corner

* Why

There used to be a nice extension called BookBurrito that did something similar, but it seems to have vanished.
